### WARNING: THIS IS OBVIOUSLY EXPERIMENTAL AND CARRIES THE DANGERS OF OVERCLOCKING (FOR REAL OVERCLOCKING). Please proceed with caution.

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put "LOLIcon.skprx" in 'tai' folder in the root of your Vita. (Or just use autoplugin, because I'm sure a ver that supports this is out already)

```text
*KERNEL
ur0:tai/LOLIcon.skprx
```

After that just reboot and press SELECT + UP to enable menu. Press SELECT + DOWN to close menu.
